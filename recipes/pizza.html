    <h3>Vegeterian Pizza</h3>
    <p>Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened 
        wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients,
         which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.
          A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta.</p>

        <li>Transfer pizzas to a cutting board and sprinkle with with fresh basil, red pepper flakes
             and Parmesan, if using. Slice and serve! Leftover pizza keeps well in the refrigerator
