    <h3>Delicious Burgers</h3>
    <p>A hamburger is a food, typically considered a sandwich, consisting of one or more cooked
         patties—usually ground meat, typically beef—placed inside a sliced bread roll or bun. 
         The patty may be pan fried, grilled, smoked or flame broiled.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Beef</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Spices</li>
        <li>Ketchup and Mayo</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps to make a Burger:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, mix ground beef, egg, onion, bread crumbs, Worcestershire, garlic, 
            1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper until well blended. Divide mixture
             into four equal portions and shape each into a patty about 4 inches wide.</li>
        <li>Lay burgers on an oiled barbecue grill over a solid bed of hot coals or high
             heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand at grill level only 2 to 3 seconds);
              close lid on gas grill. Cook burgers, turning once, until browned on both sides
               and no longer pink inside (cut to test), 7 to 8 minutes total. Remove from grill.</li>
        <li>Lay buns, cut side down, on grill and cook until lightly toasted, 30 seconds to 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Spread mayonnaise and ketchup on bun bottoms. Add lettuce, tomato, burger, onion,
             and salt and pepper to taste. Set bun tops in place.</li>
    </ol>
